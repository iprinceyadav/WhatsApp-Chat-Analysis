This initiative is part of the partnership between the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and Wheebox ETS (Educational Testing Service), which has successfully mapped employability skills of students in higher educational institutions. The outcome of this collaboration led to the India Skills Report 2024, unveiled in November 2023, featuring insights from esteemed government and industry leaders. Key insights from the report are attached for your reference.

This year, AICTE and Wheebox are launching the India Skills Report 2025, themed “Global Talent Mobility.” The test will assess the global employability market and share valuable data with corporate partners worldwide, creating more job opportunities for our students.

Important: All students must register on the Wheebox platform by 9:00 PM today using the link below: Wheebox Registration Link

Upon registration, you will receive an assessment and a certificate, which will help you benchmark your skills.

Additionally, please complete the following form for consolidating data and test planning: Google Form Link

15/11/24, 9:53 pm - +91 88719 90974: 🎨 *Pixel Palette: Chaos Edition!** 
Welcome to the ultimate canvas of chaos! A 100x100 pixel grid where art, trolling, and absolute mayhem collide every 5 seconds.  
How to Play:  
🖌️ *Pixel Picasso*: Use the API to create a banana morphing into a spaceship. Is it art? Maybe. Is it chaos? Absolutely.  

🤝 *Friendly Sabotage*: Spot a masterpiece and sneakily turn it into Shrek. Chaos is an art form too.  

🚩 *Flag Fights*: Claim a chunk for your country, fandom, or pet. Extra points if your flag makes sense.  

🛡️ *Pixel Protector*: Pick a pixel and defend it like it’s your life’s mission. Change it back the second someone dares touch it.  

🐢 *Slow Meme*: Painstakingly draw a meme, pixel by pixel. Someone will ruin it halfway—embrace the drama.  

👾 *Pixel Prankster*: Randomly tweak someone’s masterpiece. Boom, “modern art.”  

The rules? None. The fun? Infinite. The chaos? Guaranteed. Let the madness begin! 😈

🚀 Hey everyone!

We’re in the 2nd year of our college journey, which is the perfect time to explore new opportunities, build connections, and grow as individuals. One of the best ways to challenge ourselves and learn is by participating in hackathons. They’re not just competitions but platforms to innovate, collaborate, and create something impactful.

But let’s be honest — finding the right team, discovering opportunities, and getting started can feel overwhelming. That’s something we all struggle with, and it's something we can change.

To make this journey smoother for all of us, Aryan Jaiswal and I (Avinash Sharma) have developed Connectify, a platform built specifically to help students like us:

✨ Discover upcoming hackathons (we're expanding this feature soon!).
✨ Chat with like-minded peers to discuss ideas, team up, and learn from each other.
✨ Network with students and professionals from different colleges and industries.
✨ Get access to resources, mentorships, and referrals to guide your journey.

💡 And here’s the best part: Our next big update will help you find your dream hackathon team! Imagine never struggling again to find teammates or missing out on hackathons because you couldn’t connect with others.

Let’s use this opportunity to build a stronger tech culture in our college. Let’s make sure none of us feels left behind when it comes to seizing opportunities.

🌟 The future is created by those who dare to connect, collaborate, and create. Let’s be those people.

If you find any bugs or have ideas to make Connectify better, feel free to ping me or Aryan directly! We’d love to hear from you — together, we can make this platform even better.

Start small, dream big. Who knows — the next big innovation could be born in a hackathon, with a team you found here in our group or through Connectify.

Let’s make it happen! 🚀

Cheers,
Avinash Sharma & Aryan Jaiswal
