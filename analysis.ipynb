A 100x100 pixel grid where art, trolling, and absolute mayhem collide every 5 seconds.  \\nHow to Play:  \\n🖌️ *Pixel Picasso*: Use the API to create a banana morphing into a spaceship. Is it art? Maybe. Is it chaos? Absolutely.  \\n\\n🤝 *Friendly Sabotage*: Spot a masterpiece and sneakily turn it into Shrek. Chaos is an art form too.  \\n\\n🚩 *Flag Fights*: Claim a chunk for your country, fandom, or pet. Extra points if your flag makes sense.  \\n\\n🛡️ *Pixel Protector*: Pick a pixel and defend it like it’s your life’s mission. Change it back the second someone dares touch it.  \\n\\n🐢 *Slow Meme*: Painstakingly draw a meme, pixel by pixel. Someone will ruin it halfway—embrace the drama.  \\n\\n👾 *Pixel Prankster*: Randomly tweak someone’s masterpiece. Boom, “modern art.”  \\n\\nThe rules? None. The fun? Infinite. The chaos? Guaranteed.
